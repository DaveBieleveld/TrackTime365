Let's run the unittest [UNIT_TEST_NAME] and verify using pytest and verify using pytest.

Now I want to expand the program so that it separates the categories in a different table calendar_categories. There will be a many to many relation to calendar_evenets


Now, let's see if we can make this program also read recurring events. Do not go further then 5 years back and 5 year in the future for recurring events. 
I'm not interested in the recurring pattern, just treat each occurrence as a seperate event. Also beware if a recurring event was overriden with a specific event.
We should leave existing implementation intact as much as possible. Test if the current functionality still works.
